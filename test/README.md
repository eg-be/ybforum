# Test instructions

Most tests are about validating the queries againts the underlying database, therefore a test-database is required.

## Prepare test database
Install mysql and create a user and an empty database. For convenience, the username, password and 
database-name should correspond with the values in [DbConfig.php](../web/model/DbConfig.php).
